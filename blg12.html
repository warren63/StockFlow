                        <h2>Warren Buffett - Chairman & CEO | Berkshire Hathaway</h2>
<img src="images/blg12.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" id="hp1"/>
                        <p> Warren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930, to his mother Leila and father Howard, a stockbroker-turned-Congressman. The second oldest, he had two sisters and displayed an amazing aptitude for both money and business at a very early age. Acquaintances recount his uncanny ability to calculate columns of numbers off the top of his head—a feat Warren still amazes business colleagues with today. While other children his age were playing hopscotch and jacks, Warren was making money. At only six years old, Buffett purchased six-packs of Coca-Cola from his grandfather's grocery store for 25 cents and resold each of the bottles for a nickel, pocketing a 5-cent profit. Five years later, Buffett took his first step into the world of high finance. At eleven years old, he purchased three shares of Cities Service Preferred at $38 per share for both himself and his older sister Doris. Shortly after buying the stock, it fell to just over $27 per share. A frightened but resilient Warren held his shares until they rebounded to $40. He promptly sold them—a mistake he would soon come to regret. Cities Service shot up to $200.1 The experience taught him one of the basic lessons of investing: Patience is a virtue. </p>
		<p>In 1947, Warren Buffett graduated from high school when he was 17 years old. It was never his intention to go to college. His father had other plans for him and urged his son to attend the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. Buffett only stayed two years, complaining that he knew more than his professors. He returned home to Omaha and transferred to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Despite working full-time, he managed to graduate in only three years. Buffett approached graduate studies with the same resistance he displayed a few years earlier. He was finally persuaded to apply to Harvard Business School, which rejected him as "too young." Slighted, Warren then applied to Columbia, where famed investors Ben Graham and David Dodd taught—an experience that would forever change his life. </p>
		<p>  Buffett returned home and took a job at his father's brokerage house and began seeing a girl by the name of Susie Thompson. The relationship eventually turned serious, and in April of 1952, the two were married. They rented out a three-room apartment for $65 a month; it was run-down, and the young couple shared the space with a family of mice. It was there that their daughter, also named Susie, was born. In order to save money, they made a bed for her in a dresser drawer. During those initial years, Buffett's investments were predominately limited to a Texaco station and some real estate, but they were not successful. He also began teaching night classes at the University of Omaha. Then, Graham called one day and invited the young stockbroker to come to work for him. Buffett was finally given the opportunity he had long awaited. </p>
		<p> Buffett's role at Berkshire Hathaway had actually been somewhat defined years earlier. On May 10, 1965, after accumulating 49% of the common stock, he named himself director. Terrible management had run the company nearly into the ground, and he was certain that with a bit of tweaking, it could be better managed. Immediately, Mr. Buffett made Ken Chace president of the company, giving him complete autonomy over the organization. Although he refused to award stock options on the basis that it was unfair to shareholders, Buffett agreed to cosign a loan for $18,000 for his new president to purchase 1,000 shares of the company's stock. Two years later, in 1967, Warren asked National Indemnity's founder and controlling shareholder, Jack Ringwalt, to his office. Asked what he thought the company was worth, Ringwalt told Buffett the company was worth at least $50 per share, a $17 premium above its then-trading price of $33. Buffett offered to buy the whole company on the spot: A move that cost him $8.6 million dollars.7 That same year, Berkshire paid out a dividend of 10 cents on its outstanding stock. It never happened again; Warren said he "must have been in the bathroom when the dividend was declared. In 1970, Buffett named himself chairman of the board of Berkshire Hathaway and for the first time, he wrote the letter to the shareholders. (Ken Chace had been responsible for the task in the past.) That same year, the chairman's capital allocation began to display his prudence. Textile profits were a pitiful $45,000, while insurance and banking each brought in $2.1 million and $2.6 million dollars. The paltry cash brought in from the struggling looms in New Bedford, Massachusetts, had provided the stream of capital necessary to start building Berkshire Hathaway into what it has become today. </p>
		<p>  A year or so later, Warren Buffett was offered the chance to buy a company by the name of See's Candy. The gourmet chocolate maker sold its own brand of candies to its customers at a premium to regular confectionary treats. The balance sheet reflected what Californians already knew: They were more than willing to pay a bit extra for the special See's taste. The businessman decided that Berkshire would be willing to purchase the company for $25 million in cash. See's owners were holding out for $30 million but soon conceded. It was the biggest investment Berkshire or Buffett had ever made. Following several investments and an SEC investigation, Buffett began to see Berkshire Hathaway's net worth climb. From 1965 to 1975, the company's book value rose from $20 per share to around $95. It was also during that period that Warren made his final purchases of Berkshire stock. (When the partnership distributed the shares, he owned 29%.). Years later, he had invested more than $15.4 million dollars into the company at an average cost of $32.45 per share.) That brought his ownership to over 43% of the stock, with Susie holding another 3%. His entire fortune was placed in Berkshire. With no personal holdings, the company had become his sole investment vehicle. In 1976, Buffett once again became involved with GEICO. The company had recently reported amazingly high losses, and its stock had been pummeled down to $2 per share. He wisely realized that the basic business was still intact; most of the problems had been caused by an inept management team. Over the next few years, Berkshire built up its position in this ailing insurer and reaped millions in profits. Graham, who still held his fortune in the company, died in September of the same year, shortly before the turnaround. Years later, the insurance giant would become a fully owned subsidiary of Berkshire. </p>
		<p> Later, Buffett once again showed his tendency of bucking the popular trend. In 1981, Berkshire announced a new charity plan that Munger thought up and Buffett approved. It called for each shareholder to designate charities that would receive $2 for each Berkshire share the stockholder owned. This initiative was in response to a common practice on Wall Street of the CEO choosing who received the company's hand-outs. (Often, they would go to the executive's schools, churches, and organizations.) The plan was a huge success, and over the years the amount was upped for each share. Eventually, the Berkshire shareholders were giving millions of dollars away each year, all to their own causes. The program was eventually discontinued after associates at one of Berkshire's subsidiaries, The Pampered Chef, experienced discrimination because of the controversial pro-choice charities Buffett chose to allocate his prorated portion of the charitable contribution pool. Another important event around that time was the record level of the stock price, which hit $750 per share in 1982. Most of the gains could be attributed to Berkshire's stock portfolio, which was valued at more than $1.3 billion dollars.</p>
		<p> A year later, in 1988, Buffett started buying up a significant number of shares in Coca-Cola. His old neighbor, who had become the president of Coca-Cola, noticed that someone was loading up on shares, and he became concerned. After researching the transactions, he noticed that the trades were being placed from the Midwest. He immediately thought of Buffett, whom he called. Warren confessed to being the culprit and requested that they not speak of it until he were legally required to disclose his holdings at the 5% threshold. Within a few months, Berkshire owned 7% of the company, or $1.02 billion dollars' worth of the stock. Within three years, Buffett's Coca-Cola stock would be worth more than the entire value of Berkshire when he made the investment.</p>
		<p> By 1989, Berkshire Hathaway was trading at $8,000 per share. Buffett was by then, personally worth more than $3.8 billion dollars. Within the next ten years, he would be worth ten times that amount. Before that would happen, there would be much darker times ahead, including being involved in something called The Salomon Scandal. A banking company acquired by Buffett broke rules with its bond trading. The government was prepared to come down hard on the bank, so Buffett intervened, took over the company, and reached a settlement with the Justice Department. </p>
		<p> During the remainder of the 1990s, the stock catapulted as high as $80,000 per share. Even with this astronomical feat, as the dot-com frenzy began to take hold, Warren Buffett was accused of "losing his touch." In 1999, when Berkshire reported a net increase of 0.5% per share, several newspapers ran stories about the demise of the "Oracle of Omaha. Confident that the technology bubble would burst, Warren Buffett continued to do what he did best: Allocate capital to great businesses that were selling below intrinsic value. His efforts were rewarded. When the markets finally did come to their senses, Warren Buffett was once again a star. </p>
		<p>On May 1, at the company's annual shareholder meeting, Charlie Munger hinted that Buffett would be succeeded by Greg Abel, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Vice Chairman in charge of non-insurance operations. Two days later, in an interview with CNBC, Buffett confirmed this to be true, but said that he has no plans to retire anytime in the near future.</p>
