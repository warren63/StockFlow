                        <h2>5 Common Mistakes You Should Avoid While Investing In Stock Market</h2>
                        <p>

		<ul type="disc">
		<li><b><u>DO YOUR OWN ANALYSIS</u></b></li><br><p>If you want to begin investing in the stock market, then you have to learn how to analyse the companies. Do not follow random advice even if it is from somebody really close to you, be it your friends or relatives. Remember, your money is only yours, not theirs. So, always make sure to settle on a decision after doing your complete analysis. Yes, you can discuss what you have analysed with different investors and even listen to peoples’ advice. But, the final decision has to be yours. Like how in life, we thoroughly understand the situation, analyse the situation, before making any decision. We do take external advice which is not at all a bad idea. But, following that advice blindly, surely is. Do an in-depth analysis of the company before buying its shares. Do not invest in any company after reading news about them. You cannot invest in any company after reading their news, because any company doesn’t run only on a few aspects. So, it’s better to learn about that company’s business, products, services, ethics, and corporate governance before investing in it. If you think that it is not possible for you to do the analysis or you do not have time to do that. So, it is better that you invest in mutual funds. In Mutual Fund Investments, professional fund managers manage your money.</p>
		<li><b><u>AVOID PENNY STOCK</u></b></li><br><p>Another important point that beginners should keep in mind is to stay away from penny stocks. A lot of beginners who start investing with a smaller amount gravitates towards penny stocks. They most likely tend to buy stocks whose prices are lower than ₹20-25 without even doing the proper analysis of that company. They think that instead of buying 10-20 stocks of ₹500-₹1,000, it is better to buy 100-200 shares of ₹5-₹10. If there is any fluctuation in the stock market, still we will get a good amount of profits. Some beginners think that companies with lower stock prices are new companies and have just entered the stock market, which is not true. There are a lot of companies which are there in the stock market since quite long have performed poorly in the market, resulting in their stocks prices falling down to even less than ₹10-₹20. Their market capitalisation has also gone fairly down. Make sure to know the reason behind the fall of the prices of the company before investing in penny stocks. Mostly, the information of penny stocks is not easily available due to which it becomes difficult to do their analysis. So, until you get the hang of the stock market and become experts, it will be better if you stay away from penny stocks.</p>
		<li><b><u>HAVE PATIENCE</u></b></li><br><p>The one quality which is fairly common in all the successful investors is, patience. It is important to be patient in order to buy the stocks at correct valuation. When we have money, we often tend to buy any stock at any valuation without even realising what could go wrong. Warren Buffett, who is the biggest and the most successful investor in the world once said that, as much he has made successful investments, has cash to them even more than that and that he patiently waits. If you just want to get 8% a year on average, you can just throw money in a market fund or index fund, that’s pretty easy. But, if you want to try to get 20-40% a year, those types of high gains, then you really need to understand that it is hard work and patience. If you are a long term investor, then you have to give some time to your investment in order to see the best of results. It doesn’t mean you go and invest in any random stock, but patiently wait. </p>
		<li><b><u>DON’T START WITH A LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</u></b></li><br><p>Most of the beginners start with a huge amount of capital. Because of being a newbie in the market, they often do not know a lot of things practically. Why would we want to go big directly for the first time? Because we are greedy for a bigger amount of profits. Beginners do not even have sufficient amounts of expertise due to which there are more chances of losses. So, always start with a small amount and then slowly and steadily go big. </p>
		<li><b><u>STAY AWAY FROM STOCK TIPS</u></b></li><br><p>Some beginners work on stock tips given by others which are completely wrong. Also, we can see a huge rise in the scams due to stock tips. We have also learned this in the first tip that we should also do a detailed analysis of each and every stock and how we should not follow everyone blindly. You cannot listen too much to others, whether it is media, people or websites for that matter. Even if anybody tells you that this stock is horrible and you should not invest in that and you believe in yourself and that it is a right decision, then you might make it into a great stock. Sometimes analysts are so far wrong with the stock they will have a buy rating and that stock will just be going down, and then they wait and bring their celebration until that stock already bottomed out and at that point, it has already gone back higher. So, trust yourself more than anybody else. Investing in the stock market is not as difficult as climbing a mountain and not as easy as a piece of cake as well. But, we try things, we make mistakes, we learn from those mistakes, and that’s how we grow and become better and better. So, always make sure to keep these 5 important tips in mind while investing in the stock market and you never know, you also could become the next big thing in the Stock Market.</p>
