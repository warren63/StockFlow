                        <h2>The crypto collapse: Here’s what’s behind bitcoin’s sudden drop</h2>
<img src="images/blg15.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" id="hp1"/>
                        <p>The dramatic pullback in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies comes as a flurry of negative headlines and catalysts, from Tesla CEO Elon Musk to a new round of regulations by the Chinese government, have hit an asset sector that has been characterized by extreme volatility since it was created. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to more than three-month lows on Wednesday, dropping to about $30,000 at one point for a pullback of more than 30% and continuing a week of selling in the crypto space. Ether, the main coin for the Ethereum blockchain network, was also down sharply and broke below $2,000 at one point, a more than 40% drop in less than 24 hours. Part of the reason for bitcoin’s weakness seems to be at least a temporary reversal in the theory of broader acceptance for cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, Musk announced he was buying more than $1 billion of it for his automaker’s balance sheet. Several payments firms announced they were upgrading their capabilities for more crypto actions, and major Wall Street banks began working on crypto trading teams for their clients. Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange company, went public through a direct listing in mid-April.</p>
		<p>However, Musk announced last week that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns. He did suggest on Wednesday that Tesla is not selling its existing bitcoin holding, using emojis on Twitter to say the company has “diamond hands.” And Coinbase, which surged above $400 shortly after its first trade on April 14, quickly gave up those gains and was down near $220 per share on Wednesday morning. Its direct listing date is also the day of bitcoin’s most-recent all-time high. Additionally, a new report from JPMorgan said that, based on futures contracts, institutional investors appeared to be moving away from bitcoin and back to gold. Bitcoin is often touted as a potential replacement for the traditional metal as a store of value. Bitcoin and related assets have also come under increased scrutiny from regulators around the world as they have grown into a bigger part of the financial markets. “We believe government crackdown on cryptocurrencies can trigger another ‘crypto winter’ and reduced trading activity. Harsher crackdown on crypto is possible in many developing countries which may view crypto as a threat to their fiat currencies and monetary system,” Bernstein’s Harshita Rawat said in a note Tuesday. China, which is developing its own government-run cryptocurrency, reasserted its rules against other digital currencies on Tuesday, banning financial companies from providing services for crypto trading. In the U.S., newly appointed Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said earlier this month that he thought regulators should be “technology neutral” but more consumer protection is needed in crypto markets.</p>
		<p>The rise of dogecoin, which was started purely as a joke before gaining wider popularity with the help of Musk, could also have hurt the overall credibility of the crypto market. Some of the moves in the smaller, less-developed coins suggest that the crypto bull market was tied to the rise of speculative day trading in stocks instead of the increased institutional interest. Other less serious cryptocurrencies have also seen increased interest in recent weeks. On Monday, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy announced that he purchased $40,000 of a cryptocurrency called safemoon, which he described as a “scoin.”</p>
