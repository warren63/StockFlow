                        <h2>Rakesh Jhunjhunwala - The big bull</h2>
                        <p>This Rakesh Jhunjhunwala backed IT software products company — Nazara Technologies — stock hit a new life high to Rs 2087.35 apiece after rallying for around 9 per cent on the BSE intraday Tuesday. The shares have breached its previous high of Rs 2026.9 per share made during listing on March 30, 2021. Moreover, the stock in the last two sessions have jumped almost 17 per cent on the BSE. Similarly, the counter has soared near 32 per cent in the last 15 trading sessions, outperforming the benchmark as against almost 4.5 per cent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex during same period. It has spurted over 90 per cent from its issue price of Rs 1101 per share, as amid buying post listing. An ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who is also termed as the Big Bull of the Indian stock market, held 32,94,310 equity shares, which comprises 10.82 per cent of holding in the company, as per the company’s June 2021 shareholding pattern available on the BSE. </p>
		<p>In 1947, Warren Buffett graduated from high school when he was 17 years old. It was never his intention to go to college. His father had other plans for him and urged his son to attend the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. Buffett only stayed two years, complaining that he knew more than his professors. He returned home to Omaha and transferred to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Despite working full-time, he managed to graduate in only three years. Buffett approached graduate studies with the same resistance he displayed a few years earlier. He was finally persuaded to apply to Harvard Business School, which rejected him as "too young." Slighted, Warren then applied to Columbia, where famed investors Ben Graham and David Dodd taught—an experience that would forever change his life. </p>
		<p>Rakesh Jhunjhunwala along with his wife Rekha and associates publicly holds around 38 stocks in finance to tech and retail to pharma sectors, and also manages the asset firm Rare Enterprises. Nazara Technologies is engaged in providing subscription/ download of games/ other content through consumer base in India and worldwide and digital support services to group companies. Availability of smartphones and affordable technology, rising disposable income, the industry is in its growth launchpad and gradual penetration to untapped market will fuel the growth and the Industry can make valuable contribution to the economy, the company said in the FY 2020-21 annual report. The company is looking forward to build on Nazara’s leading market position and growth opportunity in India. To enhance existing offerings and increase monetisation opportunities, pursue strategic investment and acquisition opportunities and further build the existing technology stack to enhance existing platform, the company said.</p>
		<p>We got a glimpse of insider trading in Scam 1992 and while Harshad Mehta also indulged in it and was penalised by SEBI, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala too has been under the scanner of the financial regulator. Recently, it was reported by Business Today that Jhunjhunwala earned ₹5.56 crore per day since 23rd March just from one company, Escorts Ltd. The key to him making profits was holding on to the shares despite losses in between to earn greater profits in the long term. He has been in the market for long now and is known for taking risks and making calculated investments. Rakesh also contributes significantly to philanthropic causes and revealed his plan of giving away 25% of his wealth to charity by July 2021. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala wanted to become the next big name after Harshad Mehta's downfall, and here he is claiming and keeping the title as the Big Bull of Dalal Street.</p>
		<p>Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is extremely bullish on the banking sector, including the so-called inefficient banks. In a recent TV interview, Jhunjhunwala said that the inefficient banks have very high cost-income ratios, which will fall dramatically. He also expects India to grow at 14-15 per cent nominal GDP this year and 10-12 per cent nominal GDP over the coming years. The big bull also said that his bullish views on India are based on structural changes that have taken place over the last few years in the country. He hailed the digitisation initiatives amid COVID-19 pandemic, which facilitated the ‘work from home’ set up. Jhunjhunwala doesn’t see any COVID-19 wave coming that may impact Indian share markets. “Wave or no wave, Indian economy is much better prepared to face this kind of crisis,” he said. He also advised investors to stay cautious in markets and said that even if there is a third wave, markets are already discounting it.</p>
