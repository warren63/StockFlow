                        <h2>Gautam Adani - Chairman & Founder | Adani Group</h2>
<img src="images/blg14.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" id="hp"/>
                        <p>Mr. Gautam Adani is the founder and the Chairman of the Adani Group which ranks among the top 3 industrial conglomerates in India. Mr. Adani, a first-generation entrepreneur, is driven by the core philosophy of infusing “Growth with Goodness” through his vision of nation-building. Each of the Group’s businesses are focused on helping build world-class infrastructure capabilities to help accelerate the growth for India. Adani Group is constituted of 6 publicly listed entities with combined market capitalization in excess of with businesses spanning across Energy, Ports & Logistics, Mining & Resources, Gas, Defence & Aerospace and Airports. In each of its business areas, the Group has established leadership position in India. Nation-building, for Mr. Adani, means transforming the coastline of India by building a series of ports and logistics hubs, thus generating several tens of thousands of jobs. It means transforming the power scenario in India and mitigating the urban rural divide by delivering electricity to several hundreds of millions living in the hinterlands of India. It means enabling food security by building a modern agriculture supply chain empowering the farmers of our country. It means to fulfill India’s energy requirements and become one of the largest players in sustainable energy by making the largest commitment to the renewables ecosystem spanning across solar manufacturing, generation, and solar park businesses. It means playing an instrumental role in helping India become self-reliant in defence and security, and making India the hub for defence manufacturing. The Group has a strong track record of working with global leaders who want to participate in the India growth story; the global expertise of these international companies in their respective businesses, combined with the local execution and market capabilities of Adani Group has created enduring partnerships. The list of partners includes the likes of Wilmar Group, Total SA and Elbit Systems, among others. Adani Foundation, the Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility arm is among his key interest areas. The Foundation’s pan-India initiatives across key sectors of education, healthcare, sustainable livelihoods and community infrastructure development touch more than 3.4 Million lives annually in 2315 villages across 18 Indian states.</p>
		<p>Believing that India will be a 15 trillion-dollar-plus economy, Adani said, "India will be a 5 trillion-dollar economy – and then go on to be a 15 trillion-dollar-plus economy over the next two decades. India will emerge as one of the largest global markets, both in terms of consumption size and market cap. He added that there is "no reason to believe that over the next two decades we will not have been able to suitably address the challenges ahead of us." Started in 2015, Adani Green Energy became the largest solar company in the world in 2020, the second richest person in India said. "Following the acquisition of SB Energy’s five-gigawatt portfolio, at an enterprise valuation of about 3.5 billion dollars, we caught up to our renewables target of 25 gigawatts a full four years ahead of schedule." Talking about help his group provided during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gautam said Adani Group reached out all across the world to find essentials like liquid medical oxygen, oxygen cylinders and cryogenic tanks. He also said that his firm moved thousands of desperately need supplies by means of sea, rail and road.</p>
		<p>Billionaire Gautam Adani said his group’s bets to diversify across sectors and expand in related segments in each of those businesses will drive growth. “Whatever businesses we are now in — seaports, airports, logistics, natural resources, thermal and renewable power generation, transmission, distribution, data centres, defence, agri and food, real estate, city gas utilities, and several others, I believe all of them are individually high growth businesses,” Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group, said during the annual general meeting of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zones Ltd. The group has a distinctive ‘Adani Model’ that combines the power of adjacencies and bridges business-to-business-to-consumer capability, he said, referring to expansion into related sectors and building an integrated model that covers entire chain from origin to end user. That, he said, has put the company on a path to “infinite possibilities”. “I know of no other such growth model that offers unprecedented and ever-increasing access to an unlimited B2B (business-to-business) and B2C  market for the next several decades.</p>
